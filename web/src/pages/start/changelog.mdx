## 0.1.0

- Removed the `contain:*` keyword from the `box-` utility property in favor of `shear-`
- Adds the [pre Component](/components/pre)
- Adds the [Tooltip Component](/components/tooltip)
- Adds the [Table Component](/components/table)
- Adds a half-block height variants to [Buttons](/components/button) so they don't appear so tall

### Migration Guide from 0.0.x

#### Box Containment

In versions prior to 0.1.0, a second keyword was added to the `box-` utility property to control whether the box should pad the top and/or bottom lines

```html
<div box-="square contain:!top"></div>
<div box-="square contain:!bottom"></div>
<div box-="square contain:none"></div>
```

This has been replaced with the `shear-` property

```html
<div box-="square" shear-="top"></div>
<div box-="square" shear-="bottom"></div>
<div box-="square" shear-="both"></div>
```

Since the selector for `box-` no longer allows more than one keyword, most elements using the `box-` utility will be affected by this change

#### Button Variants

The default button variant has been changed to make the button shorter

<Example 
    stylesheets={[
        buttonStyle, 
    ]}
    css={`body {
    display: flex;
    align-items: flex-start;
    gap: 1ch;
}`}
    html={`<button size-="large">Large (old default)</button>
<button>Default</button>
<button size-="small">Small</button>
`}
/>

The `default` button variant is still three lines tall but appears to be shorter as its background doesn't take up the full height of three lines
